# Landing Page Project

## Systemization

* The starter project had some HTML and CSS displaying a static version of the Landing Page project. I then converted this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

* I got started by opening the `js/app.js`, and started building out the app's functionality. Some of which include the activeSection, buildNav, some more, just to name a few.

* As changes were being made, I also had to update the `styles.css` and `index.html`. I manually added some more sections to the html to confirm the navigation functionality worked perfectly.

Do have a good time previewing this project! I had fun working on it, hopefully you do as well :)
